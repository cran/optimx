<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This vignette is intended to aid understanding and maintenance of the function
minimization methods available to users of R. R users commonly, if incorrectly,
call this optimization, though most base or packaged methods for “optimization”
carry out unconstrained or bounds constrained function minimization.</p>
<h2 id="general-approach">General Approach</h2>
<p>The general problem is to find the vector of parameters \(x\) that gives at least a local
minimum of an objective function \(f(\mathbf{x}, Y)\), where Y is a collection of exogenous data that
is needed to compute the function, possibly subject to constraints that for generality
could be expressed as a vector of functions that are positive. That is</p>
<p>$$   \mathbf{c}(\mathbf{x},Y)  \geq  \mathbf{0} $$</p>
<p>We do not attempt to consider here the annoying detail of a constraint requiring strictly
“greater than” constraints. In such cases, the expedient is to use a tiny quantity in place
of the relevant zero.  Furthermore, maximization of  \(f(\mathbf{x}, Y)\)
can be achieved by minimizing  \((-1) * f(\mathbf{x}, Y)\).</p>
<p>From  \(f(\mathbf{x}, Y)\), we can generally compute two important related objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the <strong>gradient</strong> of  \(f(\mathbf{x}, Y)\) is the vector of first partial derivatives with respect
to the parameters  \(\mathbf{x}\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <strong>Hessian</strong> of  \(f(\mathbf{x}, Y)\) is the matrix of second partial derivatives with respect
to the parameters  \(\mathbf{x}\). In one dimension, the Hessian is the slope of the gradient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gradient minimizers</strong> are minimization methods that require the gradient or an approximation
to be available. Other minimizers are either <strong>direct search</strong> approaches or <strong>stochastic</strong> methods
that use pseudo-random trial sets of parameters. From gradient-related calculations, gradient
minimizers propose a <strong>search direction</strong> \(\mathbf{t}\) then try to find new sets of parameters
with lower function value by moving from  \(\mathbf{x}\) along  \(\mathbf{t}\). At some such lower
point, a new search direction is computed and a new search begun. This iterative process stops
when no more progress can be made.</p>
<p>As with many similar tasks, the details give rise to a great many particular algorithms and
programs. There can be no proof that any particular choice is “best”, and we rely on
accumulated experience with test and other problems to suggest the best approaches in
particular situations.</p>
<h2 id="line-search">Line Search</h2>
<p>The <strong>line search</strong> is a key sub-problem for gradient minimization methods, and for convenience
we will discuss it first, then move on to the issue of choosing a method to compute search directions.</p>
<p>The line search is an attempted one-dimensional minimization of</p>
<p>$$ z(s) =  f(\mathbf{x} + s * \mathbf{t}, Y) $$</p>
<p>since \(s\) is a scalar. We assume that \(\mathbf{t}\) is a descent direction, and indeed this should be
verified within programs, since rounding and other errors may cause that assumption to
be violated. Typically we look for a negative gradient projection \(\mathbf{g}^t * \mathbf{t}\).
Since we are only looking at positive \(s\) values, 0 is a lower bound to the line search.
We also may need to contend with lower and upper bounds (box constraints) on the parameters
\(\mathbf{x}\) that provide an upper limit \(s_{max}\).</p>
<p>Line search methods follow a couple of standard themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>generate trial values of \(s\) by some reasonable heuristic and stop when the derived parameters
\(\mathbf{x}\) satisfy some <strong>acceptable point</strong> criterion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>choose a suitable set of values of \(s\) so that a <strong>model</strong> \(m(s)\) of the function \(z(s)\) can be
approximated. This model should be one for which the minimizing value \(s_m\) is easily computed,
and we compute \(z(s_m)\) in the hope that it is lower than any objective function value so far
found.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Acceptable” is a slippery concept, but commonly some version of the Wolfe or Armijo conditions (see
\url{<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfe_conditions%7D">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfe_conditions}</a>) are used. This is slightly stronger than
requiring that the function value has simply been lowered in our search. However, we have
not got any assurance that we have “minimized” \(z(s)\). It is important to at least check that
the new point is “lower” than any other so far, and to use the lowest point found so far. Depending
on the manner in which the search direction \(\mathbf{t}\) has been generated, we then may try a different
search direction such as the negative gradient \(\mathbf{t} = -\mathbf{g}\) or, if we are satisfied
no further progress is possible, terminate the minimization.</p>
<p>Similarly annoying is the possibility that our model does not do a good enough job of
approximating \(z()\). The blackboard description of the process leaves out a great deal
of the software safeguards needed to avoid silly answers being proposed to problems.</p>
<h3 id="backtracking-line-search">Backtracking line search</h3>
<p>Let us consider a simple but quite effective strategy that is used in the <code>Rvmmin</code>
Variable Metric minimizer (which uses the same underlying algorithm as <code>optim::BFGS</code>
in base R).</p>
<p>Given a downhill search direction \(t\), the gradient projection \(q = \mathbf{g}^t * \mathbf{t}\),
a small number (e.g., 0.0001) which we call \(\alpha\) and some initial value of \(s\), we</p>
<p>A) compute \(z(s)\)</p>
<p>B) If \(z(s) &lt; z(0) + s * q * \alpha\), accept \(s\) as an acceptable point;
otherwise reduce \(s\) and repeat from (A).</p>
<p>If there are bounds constraints, the initial \(s\) may be limited by the distance to the
closest bound. If this is smaller than the default initial stepsize, it may reduce the
number of trial sets of parameters in the backtracking stepsize reduction.</p>
<p>Typically \(s\) is reduced by some fixed ratio, e.g., multiplying by a number such as 0.5 (halving)
or some other fraction. I like 0.15 or 0.2 in order to reduce the stepsize quickly when that is
important.</p>
<h3 id="quadratic-inverse-interpolation-line-search">Quadratic inverse interpolation line search</h3>
<p>A fairly obvious model for \(z()\) is a quadratic one. That is,</p>
<p>$$ m(s) = a s^2 + b s + z(0) \approx z(s)   $$</p>
<p>whose minimum should be found at \(-b / (2 a)\).</p>
<p>We note that we need two more conditions to find \(a\) and \(b\). The gradient projection
provides one of these, since \(m'(0) = b \approx q\). A third piece of information
comes from evaluating \(z(s_0)\) for some choice of \(s_0\).</p>
<p>In practice, poor choices of \(s_0\) give poor results. A better approach, in my
experience at least, is to first carry out a backtracking line search to an
acceptable point (or at least a lower one), and use the stepsize to that
point as \(s_0\). This means that \(z(s_0) &lt; z(0)\). We then can solve our
model approximation to find</p>
<p>$$ a = (z(s_0) - z(0) - q * s_0)/{s_0}^2 $$</p>
<p>so that</p>
<p>$$ s_{min} = -q/(2 * a) $$</p>
<p>In software, we need to be careful how things are computed to avoid digit cancellation
or division by very small quantities, but by and large this quadratic approximation
approach is quite reliable and efficient.</p>
<h2 id="approximate-derivatives">Approximate derivatives</h2>
<p>The calculation of the gradient and possibly the Hessian are an important aspect
of all gradient-based methods, but an error-prone and often computationally
demanding task. The choices for the user of optimization methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to put in the intellectual effort to develop formulas and code to compute the
derivatives needed. Note that analytic expressions for deriviatives may be
available in all, or even most, cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to use symbolic or automatic differentiation (@Margossian2019). R has some built-in
tools in base R and in packages such as “Deriv” by @Deriv-manual. However, these are, in
my experience, difficult to use. While symbolic differentiation, if it works, results in analytic
expressions that can generally be implemented concisely, automatic differentiation can
generate a large amount of stored data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numerical approximation to derivatives builds on the introductory calculus idea that
the first derivative of a function \(f(x)\) of a single variable \(x\) being defined
as  $$ f’(x)  =  \lim_{h \to 0} ((f(x + h) - f(x))/h) $$
Finite differences lead to several formulas, some as simple as forward or backward
difference approximations, or the more accurate central difference formula, but
at the expense of an extra function evaluation. Greater accuracy can be obtained
using more function evaluations, as in @p-numDeriv. For the gradient and the Hessian
the number of parameters \(n\) means we need at least \(n\) and \(n^2\) evaluations
respectively. Generally evaluation of an expression for the gradient has a computational
cost not hugely larger than that of a single function evaluation. Automatic differentiation
is more complicated, but numerical approximation is often the most costly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If approximations are used, minimization software generally follows a somewhat different
trajectory of iterates – the list of sets of parameters \(\mathbf{x}\) – than the same
program using analytic gradients and Hessian. On the other hand, it has often be
observed that approximations do well in early iterations when the initial parameters
are “far” from the solution.</p>
<p>Where analytic gradients are particularly helpful is in deciding to terminate a method,
since we can be more confident that a “small” gradient norm is correctly reported.
This is especially so if the function value is quite large, since the derivative
approximations must subtract nearly equal numbers.</p>
<h2 id="bounds-and-masks-constraints">Bounds and masks constraints</h2>
<p>Bounds or box constraints complicate our programs.</p>
<p>In particular, the step size in the line search may be limited by bounds.
If \(\mathbf{l} \leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{u}\)</p>
<p>$$ s_{max} = min((\mathbf{l - x})/\mathbf{t}, (\mathbf{u - x})/\mathbf{t} ) $$
This is then used as the initial step in the line search if it is greater than
the chosen default starting step. Since we use</p>
<p>$$ z(s) = f(\mathbf{x} + s * \mathbf{t}, Y) $$
we need to compute \(\mathbf{x} + s * \mathbf{t}\) for a value of \(s\) that should
bring some elements of \(\mathbf{x}\) to a bound. Unfortunately, rounding errors can
cause elements of the parameter to very slightly violate the bound. Finite
difference derivative approximation calculations can also cause such violations.
These are difficult to properly control in software.</p>
<!-- Maybe accept value if `! badbd(x, l, u)` -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- badbd <- function(x, lo, up){ -->
<!--          val <- any(x + control$offset < lo + control$offset) |  -->
<!--                 any(x + control$offset > up + control$offset) -->
<!--          if (val) { -->
<!--            cat("BAD! x: "); print(x) -->
<!--            cat("lower : "); print(lo) -->
<!--            cat("upper : "); print(up) -->
<!--          } -->
<!--          val           -->
<!--     } -->
<!-- ``` -->
<p><strong>Masks</strong> or fixed parameters are more easily accommodated, since we can simply
force the appropriate gradient elements to zero for the fixed parameters. That is,
we apply a “mask” to the gradient to zero out those elements. However,
as a means to indicate that a parameter is fixed, we could set lower and upper
bounds for the fixed parameters as equal.</p>
<h2 id="checking-input-information">Checking input information</h2>
<p>The idea of telling our minimization program that parameters are fixed by setting
lower and upper bounds equal raises the related question of inputs that are invalid.
To clarify the vocabulary, I prefer to say a specification of a problem is <strong>infeasible</strong>
if  a parameter is not on or between lower and upper bounds. Here it is the parameters
that violate constraints. However, a problem is
<strong>inadmissible</strong> if a lower bound exceeds an upper bound, in that such a problem makes
no sense.</p>
<p>Within software, it is sometimes a great nuisance if the starting parameters \(\mathbf{x}\)
violate bounds. For example, we have updated bounds but forgotten to adjust the starting
parameters. Some programs then simply move parameters to the nearest bound and continue
with the minimization, since users generally want a solution. However, users should be
informed that initial parameters have been changed. Package <code>optimx</code> (for which this article
was originally written; see @JNRV11) provides functionality of this sort, along with a
number of other checks for inputs that could be thought of as “silly” and usually the
result of simple user errors.</p>
<p>Yet another check is that the objective function or constraints can be evaluated at the
initial parameters. R provides a useful mechanism for such checks in the <code>try()</code> function.
On the other hand, if users know that their objective function should not be evaluated
in certain regions of the parameter space, it is sometimes worth explicitly coding for
such eventualities. Here the fact that R objects can be given <strong>attributes</strong> is helpful.
Another approach is to return a very large value when a function cannot be evaluated.
In <code>optimx</code> the standard <code>control</code> list contains the element <code>bigval</code> preset to
<code>.Machine$double.xmax*0.01</code> or approximately  1.797693e+306. This is set smaller than
the biggest representable number in case any computations are performed on the returned
value, but it can be debated whether 0.01 is an appropriate reduction factor, and I welcome
discussion with users who actually apply this idea.</p>
<h2 id="steepest-descents">Steepest descents</h2>
<p>Steepest descents (or gradient descent) is one of the simplest ideas for a minimizer.
We use \(\mathbf{t} = - \mathbf{g}\), perform a line search, then repeat.</p>
<p>While one can demonstrate that the gradient provides the most “downhill” direction
of search, the iterative process tends to be quite inefficient in that it takes a
long time to converge. Nevertheless, the negative gradient is often a useful
tool to restart other methods when a method suffers some failure.</p>
<h2 id="newton-like-methods">Newton-like methods</h2>
<p>A long-standing approach to optimization is Newton’s method, though it is likely
Newton would not recognize modern forms of it.
The idea is to seek a zero (or root) of the gradient \(\mathbf{g}\). For this
we need the Hessian \(H\), i.e., the slope of the gradient in 1 dimension. We evaluate <code>H</code> and <code>g</code>
at our current point <code>x</code> and then solve</p>
<p>$$  H \mathbf{t} = - \mathbf{g} $$</p>
<p>to generate the search direction. The classic Newton method iterates with a full step of \(\mathbf{t}\),
but safeguarded Newton methods use some form of line search to ensure \(f(\mathbf{x} + s * \mathbf{t}, Y)\)
is lower than \(f(\mathbf{x},Y)\).
Iterating hopefully finds us a stationary point of
the gradient, which should be a flat point on the surface of \(f()\). Details and constraints
complicate the implementation of these ideas, and the computation of the gradient and especially the
Hessian are often very tricky.</p>
<p>Newton-like ideas inspire many other gradient methods. Commonly we wish to avoid storing  or
explicitly computing \(H\).</p>
<h2 id="variable-metric-and-quasi-newton-methods">Variable Metric and quasi-Newton methods</h2>
<p>In this article, at the risk of offending some purists, these terms will be treated as
synonymous, though some workers do make a distiction.</p>
<p>We have seen that Newton’s method gets a search direction \(\mathbf{t}\) from
solving</p>
<p>$$  H \mathbf{t} = - \mathbf{g} $$</p>
<p>If the Hessian \(H\) is invertible, then this is equivalently written</p>
<p>$$  \mathbf{t} = - H^{-1} \mathbf{g} $$</p>
<p>The central idea of variable metric (VM) or quasi-Newton (QN) methods is to replace the
initial Hessian or its inverse with some approximation that is much easier to compute
and which (hopefully) allows a simpler solution of the equations that define
\(\mathbf{t}\). In the \(k\)th iteration we perform a search along the computed \(\mathbf{t}\)
to get \(\mathbf{x_{k+1}}\) starting from \(\mathbf{x_k}\). Using “old” and “new” gradients,
parameters and function values, we derive “better” approximations of either \(H\) or
\(H^{-1}\). The goal is to have updates that are efficient to calculate and preserve
some desirable properties for the approximate Hessian or Hessian inverse such as
symmetry and positive-definiteness. The actual Hessian may not be positive definite,
though it will be symmetric.</p>
<p>The first such update was by Davidon in 1959, circulated as a mimeograph report that
was rejected by journal referees. It was finally published by SIAM as @Davidon1959-1991
when thousands of references to an essentially unpublished but critical piece of
research work became an embarrassment to the field.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidon%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Powell_formula">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidon%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Powell_formula</a> gives a
reasonable discussion of the DFP algorithm.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm</a>
presents the main alternative to the DFP approach. The BFGS family of approaches has become
dominant for the variable metric class of minimizers.  As usual, programming details can
heavily influence practical behaviour of software and there are thousands of papers and
programs. In base R, <code>optim()</code> has methods labelled <code>BFGS</code> and <code>L-BFGS-B</code>. The former is
an adaptation (I did not program it however) of my Algorithm 21 from @cnm79, which
itself was developed after a January 1976 discussion with Roger Fletcher of the method
described in @Fletcher1970 to try to find a very compact code. At the time 8K bytes was
considered a reasonable amount of memory for a small computer. <code>L-BFGS-B</code> is based on
ideas in @Byrd1995a and a quite complicated code that I feel generally uneasy discussing,
despite having worked to provide an updated version of it for R users (see @Fidler2018).</p>
<h3 id="rvmmin">Rvmmin</h3>
<p><code>Rvmmin()</code> is an all-R implementation of a bounds-constrained version of my own
Algorithm 21 from @cnm79 that is now part of package <code>optimx</code>, though it was
earlier a separate package. While the base R <code>optim::BFGS</code> can be faster, being
coded in C, it is not as easy to read, maintain or modify as the R code of
<code>Rvmmin</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conjugate-gradient-methods">Conjugate Gradient methods</h2>
<p>Extending the conjugate gradients method for solving <strong>linear</strong> equations of
@Hestenes1952 to minimizing nonlinear objective functions, @FletReeves64
started a busy field of endeavour that aims to accomplish the minimization
with as small a working memory as possible.</p>
<p>The idea is to start with some descent direction – the negative gradient is
traditional – and perform a line search. A new gradient is then combined with
information from the present line search information to produce a new
\(\mathbf{t}\) that is somehow “conjugate” to, and linearly independent of,
previous search directions. For a problem with \(n\) parameters, we can
generate at most \(n\) such directions, so must restart our process after
\(n\) <strong>cycles</strong>, or before if there are indications of “loss of conjugacy”.</p>
<p>The brilliance of @FletReeves64 is that the formulas for their
“new” search direction are extremely simple. However, there are alternative
formulations of the algorithm which, depending on various assumptions and
approximations, are almost equally simple but give somewhat different
sets of search directions and minimization performance.</p>
<p>In the 1970s I explored several such formulas for the updated search
direction, and included three possibilities in Algorithm 22 of @cnm79,
but chose that of
@Polak69 as the default. Unfortunately, my experience with this
algorithm, which is implemented in base R as <code>optim::CG</code>, has been
very unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>By contrast, an approach that melds the update ideas by @Dai2001 has led me to
build <code>Rcgmin()</code>, now part of package <code>optimx</code> (@JNRV11), though originally
an independent R package. This has proven remarkably strong in performance.
I added bounds and masks constraints.</p>
<h3 id="rcgmin-and-ncg">Rcgmin and ncg</h3>
<p>NOTE: In early 2022 I discovered a coding glitch in the bounds constrained
code that ignored the possibility that a quadratic inverse interpolation would
suggest a negative stepsize, which would be “uphill”. A crude correction to
double the best steplength so far in such cases was added to block possible
failure.</p>
<h2 id="other-ideas-for-simplifying-newton-s-method">Other ideas for simplifying Newton’s method</h2>
<p>The quasi-Newton/variable metric methods used one approximation of the Hessian
or its inverse to provide a Newton-like search direction. Another approach is
to approximately solve the Newton equations rather than approximate the Hessian.
Such methods are typically called <strong>inexact Newton</strong> or <strong>truncated Newton</strong>
methods. They often do NOT explicitly generate the Hessian, but use clever ideas
which generate, at least approximately, the effect of multiplying a vector by
the Hessian without actually having the matrix itself. Having such a matrix-vector
product allows for solution of the Newton equations using the <strong>linear</strong> conjugate
gradient or similar methods. These are iterative, and stopping them “early” may
still give a useful search direction while saving computational effort. Hence
the “inexact” or “truncated” nomenclature. See @NashTN2000 for a survey.</p>
<h3 id="rtnmin">Rtnmin</h3>
<p>The method “Rtnmin” calls the functions <code>tn()</code> or <code>tnbc()</code> (for unconstrained
or bounds constrained problems). These functions are R translations of Matlab
functions due to @SGN83. The translation is not always well-coded for R, and
these routines could be improved, but often work quite well, especially for
problems with large numbers of parameters.</p>
<h3 id="limited-memory-quasi-newton-methods">Limited-memory quasi-Newton methods</h3>
<p><code>optimx</code> offers several versions of these ideas as the bounds constrained
solvers “L-BFGS-B” from base-R <code>optim()</code> and
its revision in C as <code>lbfgsb3c</code> (Fidler2018), as well as the unconstrained solver
“lbfgs()” (Coppola2014). The idea behind these methods is to avoid storing the
full Hessian or inverse Hessian, but instead to keep only a few of the vectors
of information needed to create them via the updating formulas. The details
require care and attention. Moreover, all the “work” of these codes is
programmed in languages other than R. They are particularly helpful for problems
with large numbers of parameters. In the example below, warnings about the lack
of symmetry of the returned Hessian are suppressed.</p>
